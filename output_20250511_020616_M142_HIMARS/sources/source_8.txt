A Long, Hard Year:  
Russia-Ukraine War Lessons Learned 2023
Michael T. Hackett and John A. Nagl
ABSTRACT: This special commentary summarizes the major findings 
and lessons taken from the Russia-Ukraine War integrated research project 
conducted by members of the US Army War College class of 2024— 
all subject matter experts on their topics. It outlines seven lessons covering 
doctrinal, operational, technological, strategic, and political issues related 
to the second year of the war, including Russia’s use of mercenaries; 
the need to create a culture of mission command; ways to deal with 
a transparent battlefield because of persistent, ubiquitous surveillance; 
air superiority as a prerequisite for successful combined arms ground 
offensives; and changes to the intelligence and information domains.
Keywords: Russia-Ukraine War, Winston Churchill, mercenaries, 
mission command, air superiority
B
ritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in his famous “Blood, 
Toil, Tears and Sweat” inauguration speech, prepared his nation 
for the long and difficult fight ahead, one which would bring 
victory over the Axis powers, but only after arduous sacrifice and suffering 
by the British people. His words resound through the ages:
We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. 
We have before us many, many long months of struggle 
and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I can say: 
It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might 
and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage 
war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, 
lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. 
You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, 
victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, 
however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, 
there is no survival.1
The second year of the Russia-Ukraine War saw Churchill’s words come 
to life on the battlefields of eastern and southern Ukraine, with high-casualty 
battles around Avdiivka and Bakhmut spreading misery and neither side 
achieving significant gains in territory despite a highly anticipated Ukrainian 
counteroffensive. Consequently, despite dramatic moments such as the failed

Wagner mutiny, the second year (February 2023–February 2024) resulted 
in an apparent stalemate characterized by portions of the line of contact 
hardening into the entrenched “Surovikin Line” composed of 81 miles of deep 
trenches around Crimea that are visible from space.
Despite the static nature of the conflict, one exacerbated by delays in the 
delivery of weapons systems to Ukraine by international partners, Ukraine has 
demonstrated remarkable resolve and continues to fight. Students and faculty 
from the US Army War College previously examined the first year of the 
Russia-Ukraine War from different angles to understand what the conflict 
means for the changing character of war and draw lessons that could strengthen 
US forces. The findings and recommendations from that study are detailed 
in A Call to Action: Lessons from Ukraine for the Future Force. Highlights are 
available in an introductory chapter and a Parameters article of the same name.2
A new team assembled at the US Army War College in fall 2023 examined 
the second year of the war. While the second year did not provide the same 
cause for optimism as the first, the battlefield’s blend of conventional warfare 
and innovative technology in protracted combat revealed new lessons. This 
special commentary highlights the team’s top findings and analysis, which can 
inform the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) to equip 
and train the future force better following the devastating war that continues 
into a third year.
Mercenaries:  
The Double-Edged Sword that Reshaped the Russian Force
Russia’s increased use of mercenaries, a combat group described by Niccolo 
Machiavelli as “at once useless and dangerous” and exemplified by the Wagner 
private military company (PMC), became one of the most visible features 
of the second year of the war. For Russia, the use of these companies meets 
several objectives:
 they can claim deniability and do not strain 
Russian national resolve,
	 they allow for aggressive assault tactics with little 
to no consideration of casualty costs, and
	 they permit Russian units to employ tactics unconstrained 
by internationally accepted ethical norms.

On the national resolve front, Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin summed 
it up to skeptical audiences in Russia by stating that “those who do not want 
PMCs or prisoners to fight, who talk about this topic, who do not want 
to do anything and who, as matter of principle, do not like this topic, send your 
children to the front. . . . Either PMCs and prisoners, or your children— 
decide for yourself.”3
From a battlefield perspective, the Wagner forces, supplemented 
by a massive infusion of prisoners, turned to assault units and tactics that 
featured prominently in the battle for Bakhmut and influenced Russian forces 
to establish “Storm-Z” units employed later in the battle of Avdiivka. These 
operations divided prisoner frontline troops (zeki) from founding members 
of Wagner (osvovy), with continuous assaults that resulted in 60 percent 
casualty rates among zeki units but eventually led to Russia’s capture 
of Bakhmut in July 2023. Wagner absorbed those casualties because of its 
force structure. As one of the Ukraine team’s researchers observed, “Losses 
did not reduce the combat readiness of Wagner units because commanders, 
operators of heavy and specialized weapons, reconnaissance, and command 
remained a constant element, not participating in the assaults.” The ease with 
which private military companies adopt flexibility with the Law of Armed 
Combat, including assaulting local civilians and the high-casualty assault tactics 
disseminated into the regular Russian army, has left a legacy that has outlasted 
Prigozhin’s failed mutiny in July 2023. These changes in force structure and 
tactics suggest that the United States and its allies must prepare for the unique 
challenges of fighting “stateless” proxy forces like Wagner in future conflicts.4
The Future of Effective Combat:  
Distributed, Decentralized, and Adaptive
Wagner could push changes in force structure that the Russian military was 
slow to adopt. With the incorporation of PMC elements into the regular Russian 
army following Prigozhin’s mutiny and subsequent death, the “Storm-Z” structure 
and assault tactics became normalized in the Russian military. Russia continued 
to centralize its command and control over units on the battlefield, which 
gave Ukraine an advantage. In the second year of the war, Russia maintained 
a high level of control over forces with minimal subordinate initiative (mission 
command), unsurprising given the low level of unit training provided to Russian 
soldiers and the lack of trust that undermined unit cohesion. While Russian 
centralized command and control was effective in defensive positions, it proved 
catastrophic during offensive operations.

Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, adopted Western-style mission control in theory. 
In practice, however, they struggled to scale up mission control operations, 
given poorly trained staff at the battalion and brigade levels—a structural and 
cultural problem yet to be unwound. Developing this level of trust is woven into 
training at every echelon through TRADOC and, given the expected challenges 
of communication and isolation in the future battlefield, the military should 
redouble those efforts.5
This form of distributed operations was critical in fires direction / clearance 
and public information operations. Fires, long the “King of Battle,” have proven 
pivotal to Ukraine’s asymmetric response to Russia’s numerically superior force, 
with Western systems like the high-mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS) 
allowing Ukraine to strike deep behind Russian lines. Beyond the weapons 
systems, the decentralization of fire direction and clearance processes with 
technologies like the Ukrainian software Kropyva have enabled faster response 
times, as have the greater dispersion of artillery assets for survivability against 
counter-battery fire and loitering munitions.6
Likewise, Ukraine’s decentralization of public information operations has 
been pivotal to shoring up resolve in Ukraine and among Western partners 
and countering Russian disinformation and misinformation. Ukraine’s decision 
to afford more flexibility to its officials to speak openly and authentically has 
resonated with audiences and built crucial national support for difficult demands 
like mobilization. The Department of Defense—and the US government more 
broadly—would benefit from a similar approach of structured advocacy and 
investment in new information technologies.7
Finally, a new focus on the US Joint Force as an adaptive learning organization 
must join these distributed operations. As Russia and Ukraine grapple with 
the harsh realities of modern war, the margin for error has become increasingly 
narrow, making the ability to innovate and adapt swiftly a strategic advantage 
and necessity. The accelerating pace of technological change presents a unique 
challenge for military organizations—including our own—that are hierarchical 
and resistant to change. The highly volatile and fluid environment of the 
Russia-Ukraine War underscores this challenge. It demonstrates the value 
of increased investment in social capital and a federated approach to innovation 
and adaptation, flexibility that helped Ukraine adapt quickly to a swiftly changing 
operating environment.8
In the past, the US Army adopted this approach. Dedicating units 
to adaptability (such as Global War on Terror–era organizations like the Rapid 
Equipping Force and the Asymmetric Warfare Group) enabled rapid adaptation 
and fostered the capability to develop bottom-up solutions to counter asymmetric

threats. The US military should reconstitute both organizations and others 
like them that were discontinued to enable the flow of knowledge across the 
enterprise and accelerate the learning process. As our research team’s innovation 
and adaptation expert observes, truly embracing innovation and adaptation 
requires leadership, dedicated resources, formal and informal networks, and 
a Department of Defense culture that prioritizes continuous innovation and 
creativity supported by policies encouraging personnel to question, observe, 
network, and experiment at all leadership levels.9
Back to the Trenches
As the war ground to a stalemate in the past year, trench warfare— 
not seen at this scale in Europe since World War I—presented new challenges 
to maneuver and protection and reinforced the critical role fires will play in future 
wars. Entrenched fortifications around Crimea, and those protecting the “land 
bridge” occupied territories of southern Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, and Donetsk 
oblasts along the Sea of Azov, offer lessons in continuity and change should the 
United States return to conventional large-scale combat operations after years 
of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations.
The conflict has offered a few lessons in the field of maneuver. First, 
combined arms operations at echelon remain the most effective means of seizing 
terrain and destroying opposing forces in land combat. They are complex, and 
planners cannot assume their success. Good combined arms doctrine exists 
and must remain central to leader development and training. Second, the 
utility of unmanned systems in land combat is nascent; their full potential 
is unrealized, and they could fundamentally change the logic of tactical risk. 
Unmanned systems are proving effective at augmenting current defensive 
practices for stationary armies but have not yet proven their worth in large 
maneuvers or reached full value as offensive tools with unique functions. Finally, 
battlefield transparency is deadly. The Russian and Ukrainian armies are adjusting 
to account for the probability of being seen by threat technology that reduces 
an organization’s ability to mass offensively or to survive while massed defensively. 
Counterintuitively, techniques that enable survival on a transparent battlefield 
also undermine combined arms fundamentals; to preserve combined arms’ value, 
the enterprise must develop technological solutions that negate transparency.10
Russian defensive fortifications have brought Joseph Stalin’s famous line 
“quantity has a quality all of its own” to the modern battlefield. Russia’s use 
of mass when employing thousands of antipersonnel and anti-tank land 
mines to reinforce well-constructed defensive obstacles foreshadows
--- 페이지 6 ---
46  Parameters 54(3) Autumn 2024
challenges US Army forces will face in ground combat. As our protection 
research team concludes:
As techniques for clearing obstacles have not evolved 
in the past half-century, the U.S. Army should explore 
other ways to overcome the challenges of deep, 
reinforced obstacles. This approach should be mirrored 
in electronic warfare (EW) protection, merging offensive 
and counter-drone efforts and co-locating activities 
where possible. Machine vision technology also stands 
to dramatically change survivability operations, driving 
a need for more and better decoys and incentivizing tactics 
that confuse algorithms, not just suppress signatures. In this 
area, the Army should establish more formal programs that 
can better judge decoy technology against the latest threats 
and accelerate experimentation at its training centers. 
By tackling these challenges now, the Army might save 
in future conflict the year that Ukraine lost in mounting 
an effective counteroffensive.11
Additionally, fires are pivotal to countering conventional and EW trench 
warfare. The US Army should integrate these capabilities into strike packages 
to counter enemy jamming of precision munitions and drones, revive the use 
of camouflage netting and decoys, and limit electronic signatures when static 
to avoid detection. Based on ground experience in Ukraine, the US Army should 
develop a “suppression of enemy electronic warfare” approach like the one used 
to suppress enemy air defenses.12
By Air, by Sea
As they had in the first year of the war, multidomain operations were 
a crucial element in the second year of the war. By land, air, and sea, Ukraine 
brought the fight to Russia in asymmetrical ways that will shape combat for 
years to come. Perhaps the single most significant lesson learned from the 
Russia-Ukraine War is that air superiority is still an essential prerequisite 
to enable combined-arms maneuver. In the air domain, offense is the dominant 
form of warfare and vital to gaining air superiority. Two years into the war, 
however, neither Russia nor Ukraine gained air superiority and instead focused 
on defensive tactics of air denial. These air-denial strategies create air parity, 
where the air domain is either neutral or contested, and neither side controls 
it. Air parity creates trench warfare in the sky and, subsequently, trench warfare 
on the ground. We conclude that defensive air-denial strategies are not winning

strategies, nor will they gain air superiority. They should only be used out 
of necessity until returning to the offense.
In a contested air defense environment, the United States can no longer 
take air superiority for granted. This shift is important for the US military; after 
years of fighting with air supremacy, the Joint Force has forgotten many of its 
capabilities and doctrines learned from previous air campaigns. Our research 
team’s review of air operations in Ukraine in 2023 offers lessons for the Joint 
Force, including the need for training to air parity conditions, convergence and 
synchronization of Joint Forces to conduct multidomain offensive counter-air 
operations, improving passive and active defensive counter-air tactics, executing 
rapid and survivable kill chains at scale, exploring unmanned technologies, and 
ensuring adequate stockpiles of war materiel. These lessons should be reemphasized 
and codified into service doctrine and the Joint Warfighting Concept to ensure 
US capabilities to gain and maintain air superiority in future conflicts.13
These airpower lessons also apply to NATO, which must enhance its 
offensive and defensive counter-air operations by improving its situational 
awareness, resilience, interoperability, and innovation. Ukraine has 
demonstrated that robust air and missile defenses can impact an overall 
campaign and that air denial can be an effective interim solution—specifically 
for NATO members that lack offensive air capabilities—before NATO can 
bring its full offensive airpower to bear.14
Ukrainian operations in the maritime domain also provided important lessons. 
In the second year of the war, the rise of alliance capabilities (such as Finland and 
Sweden joining NATO and the Ukrainian Marine Corps separation from the 
Ukrainian Navy) significantly influenced the conflict in the Black Sea and Sea 
of Azov region. Likewise, 2023 maritime operations illustrated the need for the 
US Army, the US Marine Corps, and the US Navy to update doctrine to address 
warfare in deep blue, brown, and green water zones. Ukraine’s effective use 
of smaller, more agile vessels and integration of fires and unmanned aerial systems 
to target and strike large Russian warships offers valuable insights into the types 
of vessels and technology worth US research and investment.15
The Battle for Information Advantage
The Russia-Ukraine War affords vital insights into how future conflicts 
will be influenced by the abundance of digital information and the maturation 
of artificial intelligence. For US Army Intelligence, a key aspect of the conflict 
is the emergence of an ecosystem of intelligence-like commercial services. 
Companies like Palantir, Planet Labs, BlackSky Technology, and Clearview 
AI are driving this ecosystem forward. Ukraine embraces these actors and

harnesses the potential of their services to make sense of ever-increasing amounts 
of information. Artificial intelligence is a critical development area, evident 
in applications such as targeting and battle tracking, facial recognition,  
voice recognition and translation, data management, autonomous flight, 
counter-disinformation efforts, and cybersecurity. Our intelligence team suggests 
four implications for US forces:
 First, the Russia-Ukraine War demonstrates the military 
significance of technological trends shaping the operational 
environment; even if the US Army intelligence enterprise 
chooses not to adopt them, they are available to allies, 
partners, and adversaries. 
	 Second, it shows how low-cost sensors and nodes 
can be integrated at the tactical and operational levels as part 
of a persistent and resilient collection network. 
	 Third, it shows how the US Army can leverage unclassified 
information sources to foster integration with allies 
and partners. 
	 Fourth, it reveals the versatility of unclassified information 
sources in terms of improving intelligence analysis, 
stimulating innovation, and forging connections with domestic 
and foreign audiences.16
The cyber domain has proven to be another critical battlefield for information 
advantage. The offensive cyber capabilities by Russia and Ukraine have 
demonstrated that cyber operations in armed conflict are becoming more 
destructive, emphasizing the need for robust cyber defense. As with fires, 
protection, and intelligence operations, AI-enabled cloud infrastructures have 
proven critical to cyberspace defense and cybersecurity—and, as with intelligence 
operations, are best achieved through the collaborative efforts of government with 
industry and international partnerships. Our cybersecurity team observes:
Ukraine’s cyber defense effort would not have been nearly 
as successful had it not been for the voluntary intervention 
of large US-based technology firms such as Google, 
Microsoft, Amazon, SpaceX, and several other technology 
companies. These corporations, however, intervened in the 
Russia-Ukraine War at a high cost to those organizations. 
This national collaboration can be improved and repeated 
with proper planning, funding, and policy development.

Future cybersecurity strategies need to formalize private 
and commercial-sector contributions.17
The Future of Warfare—and Collective Security in Europe
Beyond the lessons learned outlined in this special commentary, how the 
war continues—and eventually ends—will be pivotal to European security 
and US national interests overseas. Continued security assistance from the 
United States and its allies—and unambiguous signaling on allied resolve—
will be critical to bolster Ukrainian military efforts to roll Russia back and 
give it a stronger hand at the bargaining table as the war moves toward 
termination. Reaching war termination while Ukraine maintains maximalist 
war aims (recovering all territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea) 
would require a significant setback to Russian resolve. While Russia currently 
maintains an advantage in that regard, its resources are not absolute. As one 
of our researchers notes, its “artificially inflated economy, high inflation, 
shrinking population, growing discontent, and propensity to take significant 
losses for marginal gain” may eventually force Russia to negotiate. From 
Ukraine’s perspective, any war termination agreement must consider a postwar 
Ukraine that has improved its security capacity, economic health, and political 
stability and be anchored firmly into transatlantic institutions such as NATO and 
regional associations in Eastern and Central Europe.18
As it has been since the war began in February 2022, continued military 
and diplomatic support by Ukraine’s partners is critical. Some of the territory 
regained by Ukraine can be attributed to the battlefield effects of US- and 
NATO-provided systems (such as HIMARS and Leopard tanks) that showed 
support may tip the balance in Ukraine’s favor. Providing weapons systems 
from many donor countries posed logistical challenges. As our research 
team’s sustainment expert observes, the challenges faced by Russia and 
Ukraine have reiterated the need for the United States to “work across the 
whole of government and industrial base to build resiliency in the production 
of equipment and munitions to ensure the ability to increase production to the 
scale and in time required, maintaining a competitive advantage and ensuring 
secure supply chains in the future.” Nearly as important as the weapons 
themselves, unified, unambiguous messaging on the systems as an enduring 
commitment to Ukraine is crucial to challenging Russia’s resolve. Where 
tentative US signaling has so far managed escalation with Russia, it runs the risk 
of undermining the credibility of US threats, commitments, and assurances in the 
long run.19
Finally, this grueling year of the war reinforced the role that genuine leadership 
plays for morale and direction. As our research team’s resiliency expert concludes,
--- 페이지 10 ---
50  Parameters 54(3) Autumn 2024
Ukraine remained resilient against Russia’s onslaught through its fabric of national 
identity, one knit together, at least partially, through its long history of generational 
trauma inflicted by its neighbor. Volodymyr Zelensky “leveraged that national 
identity and trauma to mobilize not only his military and fellow Ukrainians  
to resist . . . but also the western world to provide much needed training, funding, 
weapons, and equipment.”20
The future Joint Force will require the sophisticated weapons, doctrine, training 
that TRADOC affords, and national will and resolve to fight and win the next 
war—one that may be as prolonged and arduous as the second year of this conflict 
has been for Ukraine. By studying the lessons observed, the US Armed Forces will 
be better prepared to deter and, if necessary, win that fight.
