Impact of new fire support capabilities
from a joint functions perspective
The article highlights the usefulness of the operational framework described by the joint functions to 
understand the impact that an available capability has on the operation from an actional point of view. At 
the same time, this framework can also be exploited for the purpose of identifying a need for capabilities 
at the level of the current joint force in order to be able to accomplish the assigned missions. In order to 
argue the above, I have focused on a fire support capability that has recently become part of the national 
armed forces structures - the M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System). If in the first part 
of the article I briefly detailed aspects of the operational framework described by the joint functions, in 
the second part I presented a reasoned perspective on the impact that the capabilities of HIMARS systems 
have on the way of conceptualizing operations. The article aims to argue, through a concrete example, 
the possibility of using the operational framework described by the joint functions to understand the full 
potential of an existing or prospective capability for national armed forces structures.

T
he integration of new fire support capabilities under current or forward-looking 
equipping programs also requires, in my view, an understanding of how the 
military commander can exploit their full potential in operations. Warfighting 
functions provide a useful context for conceptualizing the way new capabilities can 
be exploited in a timely manner, according to the operational needs of the force 
structures that possess or will possess them at a given point in time. Through this 
article, I have aimed to highlight a useful way to understand the impact of new fire 
support capabilities of national armed force structures and how the commander 
and his staff can conceptualize the exploitation of the new capabilities they offer in 
planning and conducting the operations of their force structures.
For the completion of this paper, I considered the method of documentary analysis 
in order to systematically select, review and evaluate public (unclassified) sources of 
information. In this manner, I aimed to illustrate in a synthesized way a perspective 
on the potential implications of the integration of new military capabilities at the 
national level. I considered it sufficiently relevant to address the influence of a limited 
number of new or prospective military equipment capabilities using the framework 
in which combat functions manifest since, in my view, the way of constructing the 
perspective can be extrapolated to other types of equipment, capabilities or services 
available to national armed forces structures.
Joint functions are a tool, at the disposal of the commander and his staff, used 
in particular to ensure a holistic approach to all aspects of an operation and to 
visualize the specific activities of the force structures available in the operational 
framework created. Joint functions are basically a description of the capabilities 
available to the force structures. The concrete requirements of the joint force for 
the conduct of an operation are determined by the commander through the joint 
functions (NATO 2022a, 105). From this point of view, the joint functions come 
to argue the current requirements of a joint force but also the need for armed 
force structures to have modern capabilities, adapted to the current confrontation 
environment.
The operational framework described by the joint functions
Within both NATO (NATO 2022a, 105) and national perspective (SMG 2011, 70) 
(SMG 2014, 26) the joint functions are:
- fires and maneuver;
- command and control (C2);
- intelligence;
- force protection;
- information operations (INFO OPS);
- sustainment;
- civil-military cooperation (CIMIC).

It should be noted that, differently from NATO regulations, at the national level 
there are seven joint functions since manoeuvre is associated with fires in a single 
function. In the following lines, I will briefly present the main ideas of each of 
the joined functions in order to address them in the second part of this paper in 
interpreting the potential impact of new capabilities.
Fires and manoeuvre (manoeuvre and the application of firepower according to 
Romanian Army doctrine) integrate, from a national perspective as mentioned, two 
joint functions according to NATO doctrines. The main purpose of manoeuvre is 
to obtain an advantageous position in relation to the enemy that would allow the 
threat or application of force against him. At the operational level, manoeuvre is 
the process by which combat power is concentrated where it would have a decisive 
effect in preventing, disrupting or neutralizing enemy operations (NATO 2019, 
1-21). Although usually manifested physically, the manoeuvre can affect the morale 
of enemy forces by creating uncertainty, confusion and paralysis. Fire, applied by 
structures of two or more categories of armed forces, has as its main purpose to 
influence the enemy’s combat capability. The effects of fires are mainly physical, but 
they can also affect the psychological and morale components of combat power, thus 
having an impact on the enemy’s will to fight.
Command and control (C2) as a joint function is the exercise of authority by the 
commander over available forces to accomplish the mission. Operations are 
characterized by centralized planning and direction to ensure unity of effort, and 
decentralized executive authority down to the lowest echelon capable of effectively 
employing force structures. A representative element is the command-and-control 
architecture which, in today’s operating environment, is dependent on capabilities 
exploiting the increasingly congested and contested electromagnetic spectrum 
(NATO 2022b, 49).
The role of intelligence is to ensure a continuous and coordinated understanding 
of the confrontation environment, supporting the commander by identifying the 
conditions necessary to accomplish objectives, avoiding undesirable effects and 
assessing the impact of enemy action, own forces or other actors on the concept of 
operation. The intelligence joint function is an essential tool for the conduct of the 
decision-making process as it integrates the activities of the commander, staff and 
collection elements to generate the required intelligence products resulting from the 
information cycle (direction-collection-processing-dissemination).
Force protection is a function focused on eliminating or minimizing the 
vulnerability of personnel, equipment, facilities, operations and activities 
to potential threats or hazards, to ensure freedom of action and operational 
effectiveness in accomplishing the mission. Force protection is a responsibility of 
commanders at all hierarchical levels but also a fundamental ongoing responsibility 
of all personnel. Representative aspects of this function include air defence, CBRN

(Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) defence, military engineering 
and operational security.
Information Operations (INFO OPS) as a joint function integrates those actions 
and activities that produce effects on the understanding and perception, the will to 
fight and the capabilities of target entities in order to assist in the accomplishment 
of the set objectives. Key enablers of this function include psychological operations, 
deception, electronic warfare and physical destruction (SMG 2014, 33).
Sustainment refers to the coherent provision of the necessary support for the 
conduct of the operation until mission accomplishment. This support mainly 
concerns the provision of resources (human and material), medical support and 
military engineering. Rehabilitation, resupply and regeneration of force elements are 
outcomes of sustainment and play an important role in maintaining the required 
level of combat capability. The degree of sustainment has an impact on the tempo, 
duration and intensity of all types of operations.
Civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) is the coordination and cooperation of military 
commanders with civilian actors in the area of operations to accomplish the force’s 
objectives. Through this function, the commander can create and maintain conditions 
favourable to the accomplishment of his mission by exploiting moral, material or 
tactical advantages to the detriment of the enemy. Civil-military interactions are 
an important tool in achieving strategic and operational level objectives as civilian 
actors in the area of operations can have an impact on the outcome of the conflict 
situation or crisis.
Through the operational framework described by the joint functions, the commander 
combines the actions and activities of the force structures to generate effects aimed 
at influencing the enemy’s ability to understand, the level of capabilities available 
to him and his will to fight. Similarly, the activities and actions of the available 
force structures produce effects with the potential to influence the enemy’s ability 
to understand, the level of capabilities and the will to fight from the perspective of 
friendly forces or other actors in the area of responsibility.
The capabilities available at force structure level define each of the joint functions 
but, taken in isolation, these capabilities can be leveraged across multiple 
functions. The commander, in order to accomplish his mission, may choose from 
a multitude of available capabilities and combine or integrate them in a number 
of ways to accomplish the combined functions listed above. He will detail in the 
operation order the concrete way in which the available forces and assets are to be 
employed, but they are not exclusively associated with a single function. An action 
of an available force or capability can and will be exploited within more than one 
joint function.

The impact of new fire support systems
on performing joint functions
The practical conditions under which the combat power of a force can be effectively 
applied are related to an understanding of the conflict nature and the context in 
which it is manifested, the specific operating environment, the target entities with 
existing threats, and the capabilities available for friendly structures, the enemy or 
other actors present in the area of responsibility.
More often than not, the increased capabilities of modern fire support systems are 
visualized to have implications in a geographic framework of the action, through the 
increased maximum range at which they can strike targets - in the deep, close and 
rear area of operations. An example of this is the equipping of the Romanian Army’s 
land force structures with M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System), 
which, at first sight, brings to mind the maximum range at which they can engage 
targets - 70 km (for GMLRS – Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System) and 300 km 
(for ATACMS – Army Tactical Missile System). An illustrative representation of the 
impact that the maximum range of fire support systems can have on the operational 
environment can be found in Field Manual FM 3-0 Operations from 2022.
This representation shows the influence of the maximum range of fire support 
systems (available to both sides) on an area of operations perspective at the 
operational and tactical level.
Given the full range of possibilities offered by HIMARS (increased range compared 
to the artillery systems they have replaced, improved accuracy, a greater variety of 
potential munitions, the advantage of minimizing possible collateral effects, etc.) we

can consider multiple ways of exploiting these systems in the operational framework 
described by the joint functions.
I have presented below a personal perspective on equipping national land forces 
with HIMARS systems where I have integrated the main aspects in the form of a 
SWOT analysis.
Although only certain types of ammunition have been procured nationally (Defence 
DataBase 2024), this paper has considered HIMARS systems as platforms with the 
potential to utilize the full range of ammunition available to such systems. Another 
aspect worth mentioning is that in detailing the perspective of the contribution and 
integration of HIMARS systems into friendly forces’ joint functions, I have also 
addressed some aspects regarding the potential for disrupting enemy joint functions.
Fires and manoeuvre
The main contribution of HIMARS systems in the joint function fires and manoeuvre 
is the potential to diminish the combat capability of enemy force structures, either 
directly by destroying various military equipment or indirectly by influencing the 
psychological and morale status of enemy troops. The accuracy of the munitions fired

by HIMARS systems can be utilized primarily on fixed targets, such as infrastructure 
elements used by the enemy or concentrations of forces - in certain directions of 
effort, at objectives or located in various areas. Considering the variety of munitions 
(including submunitions) (Defence DataBase 2024) that can be launched by 
HIMARS systems, we can consider a wide range of effects on the enemy in direct 
support of friendly manoeuvre structures.
From the enemy’s perspective, the manoeuvre and joint fire function are disrupted by 
the ability of HIMARS systems to rapidly execute accurate fire on high-value targets. 
Thus, by employing submunition strikes (including anti-armour mines) in certain 
areas or at certain times of the operation, various effects on the enemy’s manoeuvre 
forces can be achieved such as disrupting offensive actions, and blocking or delaying 
the introduction of reserves into the battle. I mention here the direct contribution 
of HIMARS systems in Donbas to blocking the offensive of Russian forces in the

Bakhmut-Kramatorsk direction in July 2022 (Nistorescu 2024, 79). Another aspect 
of the deployment of HIMARS systems that may disrupt this joint enemy function 
is also, in my view, the polarizing effect of enemy fire support assets specifically 
intended for HIMARS detection and counteraction throughout the operation.
Another important contribution of HIMARS systems to the disruption of the 
enemy’s joint function fires and manoeuvre is their high proficiency in executing 
counterbattery fires (Global Defense News 2023). The effectiveness of HIMARS 
systems in such situations is based on their high mobility, the availability of an 
automated fire control system, and the ability to execute shoot-and-scoot fire 
missions, all in conjunction with high accuracy and lethality on target. Another 
advantage in this area may also be the development and use of munitions with 
trajectory correction systems immediately after launch, to make it impossible to 
accurately detect firing positions with counter-battery radars (Kadam 2022).
Command and control
The joint function command and control is enhanced by equipping force structures 
with HIMARS systems in several ways. One of these is the prospect of effective 
command and control of fire support through the exploitation of IFATDS. The speed 
with which the automated planning and execution of fire missions is carried out 
has implications on the ability to react, in the form of counter-battery fire, against 
enemy fire support systems aimed at disrupting the exercise of command and 
control at the joint force level. The reaction capability can also be exploited against 
targets of opportunity arising in the dynamics of action, especially those classified 
as TST (Time Sensitive Target), where HIMARS may be the only effective capability 
available to the commander.
Given the command-and-control function from the enemy’s perspective, HIMARS 
systems have proven to be particularly effective in hitting command post targets 
(BBC 2022), thereby disrupting the functionality of enemy command and control 
systems at different tactical echelons.
Intelligence
The capabilities of HIMARS systems are integrated and assist the joint function 
intelligence by contributing to the operational picture, capitalizing on the 
characteristics of the modern IFATDS fire command and control system and 
exploiting target acquisition data and information.
Disrupting the enemy’s intelligence function with HIMARS systems can be achieved 
by physically destroying equipment intended for data transmission or data collection 
such as, for example, communications centres (Kadam 2022) or counter-battery 
radars (New Voice of Ukraine 2023). The exploitation of HIMARS systems as part 
of deception plans can contribute to degrading the enemy’s ability to understand the 
real operational situation by stimulating sensors and deliberately providing certain 
information such as, for example, shifting the main effort of the force in a certain

https://doi.org/10.53477/2284-9378-24-53
direction by deploying and employing launch positions for this purpose. As an 
example, I would like to highlight the role of HIMARS systems from 2022 in the 
Russo-Ukrainian conflict, as they contributed to misleading the enemy and drawing 
attention to the province of Kherson, an action followed by the counter-offensive in 
Kharkov (Toroi 2024, 34).
Force protection
The impact of equipping with HIMARS systems on the joint function force protection 
can be understood, in my view, in two aspects, one positive and one negative. The 
positive aspect is primarily the high capability of HIMARS systems to effectively 
combat enemy strike systems from a distance, particularly those that pose a high risk 
to friendly force structures - such as tactical assets with WMD capabilities.
The negative aspect would be, in my view, the need to allocate additional or 
dedicated resources for direct protection and close defence of HIMARS systems, as 
well as for their air and missile defence throughout the entire operation. This is also 
a consequence of the fact that, as stated earlier, the HIMARS systems available to a 
force are high pay-off targets for any potential enemy.
From the enemy’s perspective, the force protection function is disrupted primarily 
by the constant need to mitigate the effects of a potential HIMARS attack, which 
may occur at considerable distances from the front line. Thus, in order to protect 
important enemy infrastructure elements, concentrations of forces or resources of 
any type, or to protect other various objectives in rear areas of operations, the enemy 
will have to take some specific measures and allocate additional resources (electronic 
warfare or air and missile defence) to mitigate the effects of HIMARS engagement.
Information Operations (INFO OPS)
The availability of HIMARS systems at the joint force level and their successful 
employment during operations can be exploited in information operations to boost 
the will to fight and the morale of friendly troops. An elementary example in this 
area can be the promotion of successful HIMARS actions among friendly forces. At 
the same time, equipping forces with HIMARS and the direct implications of this, 
such as pushing concentrations of enemy assets further away from the front line, can 
have demoralizing effects on enemy force structures in the close area of operations 
(Kosoy 2024).
Another aspect, also mentioned in the joint function intelligence, is to capitalize 
on the status of HIMARS systems as a high pay-off target for the enemy in plans 
to mislead them. The contribution of HIMARS to degrading the enemy’s ability to 
understand the operational situation can be significant.
As a characteristic element of the joint function information operations from the 
enemy’s perspective, I mention the enemy’s focus on propaganda aspects, promoting 
the destruction of HIMARS systems (Tass 2024)  or the unconventional manner of 
their use - against civilian population or objectives (Avia.Pro 2022). The disruption
--- 페이지 10 ---

BULLETIN
of this joint function can be achieved, first of all, by becoming aware of these aspects 
and then implementing countermeasures or exploiting them in the framework of 
friendly information operations.
Sustainment 
From a sustainment point of view, equipping forces with HIMARS systems have a 
major impact on the geometry of the operating environment. While from a friendly 
operations perspective, the main contribution to sustainability is, in my view, 
countering fire support systems that could disrupt the flow of resources. Regarding 
enemy operations, HIMARS systems have demonstrated a high potential to affect 
their sustainability. The maximum range at which HIMARS systems can accurately 
and effectively engage targets has been intensively leveraged (and publicized) in 
the Russo-Ukrainian conflict as they were used to strike infrastructure elements, 
force concentration areas, ammunition depots, or Russian soldier training bases 
(Kosoy 2024). Thus, we could observe that equipping friendly force structures with 
HIMARS systems may lead to a revision of the enemy’s way of deploying resources 
at considerable distances from the front line in order to remove them from the 
HIMARS engagement range.
Civil-military cooperation (CIMIC)
The advantage of using munitions that are constructively aimed at reducing the 
risk of casualties or collateral damage can be exploited in this joint function to 
strengthen support for the cause from the civilian population existing in the area of 
operations. Moreover, the population in the territory occupied by the enemy can be 
an important source of information regarding his use of military equipment or the 
conduct of activities by his forces, information which can also be exploited in the 
planning and execution of fire missions with HIMARS systems.
Concerning the disruption of the enemy’s civil-military cooperation joint function, 
special attention needs to be paid to the relationship of proportionality between 
these functions of the conflicting parties. Thus, the progress achieved by the actions 
of friendly forces in the functional area of civil-military cooperation strengthens this 
joint function while, obviously, securing enemy disadvantage.
Conclusions
Exploiting the operational framework described by the joint functions can be done 
beyond their basic role - the tool of the military commander and his staff to ensure 
a comprehensive approach to the aspects of an operation. Considering that the way 
joint functions are accomplished in an operation is also a description of the capabilities 
available to the force, it is possible to argue on their basis some new needs, by solving 
which mission fulfilment is facilitated in the current confrontation environment.
Joint functions can provide a framework for understanding and realizing the 
potential of available capabilities to the military commander, but at the same time,
--- 페이지 11 ---
136
these functions can also provide the requirements of national force structures given 
the missions they have or may have in a given context. Moreover, by conceptualizing 
the performance of these functions at the level of a potential adversary or other 
actor present in the area of operations, we can have a thorough understanding of 
the potential of the capabilities available to them, which can be exploited both in 
understanding the confrontation environment as a whole and in determining the 
centres of gravity for targeted entities.
Through the example used in this paper - the equipping of national land forces 
structures with HIMARS systems - I have argued a useful way, in my view, to 
substantiate how to capitalize on existing or prospective capabilities. At the same 
time, in writing this paper, I have presented and argued a perspective on the impact 
of equipping national armed forces structures with HIMARS systems by addressing 
their contribution or influence on the fulfilment of each joint function in particular 
with examples from the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.
