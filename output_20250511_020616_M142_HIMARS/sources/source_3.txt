The Asymmetries Generated by New Weapon Systems 
and Their Role in Achieving Success on the Battlefield.
The Impact of HIMARS on the Conflict in Ukraine
The advent of new weapon systems, which integrate the latest technologies, is transforming the battlefield 
and redefining the character of contemporary modern warfare. The recent armed conflicts in Syria, Yemen, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and Ukraine, by their complexity, serve to illustrate the diversification of threats and 
the adaptation of military capabilities to counter them. Regardless of the type of conflict, success on the 
battlefield depends on the ability to gain an advantage over the enemy and exploit it. Such an advantage 
may be derived from the realization of asymmetries on the battlefield, which may be generated at all levels 
of military operations. The equipping of the Ukrainian forces with the HIMARS system in the summer 
of 2022 has given them a significant position of advantage, creating a number of tactical and operational 
asymmetries. In this context, the objective of this research is to identify the asymmetries generated by the 
HIMARS system and to determine how they contributed to the battlefield success. The key findings are of 
significant value due to the fact that most NATO member states, including Romania, are making efforts to 
strengthen their HIMARS capabilities.

he war in Ukraine, which is characterized by extreme brutality and has 
significant implications for the future of European security, can also be viewed 
as a conflict characterized by asymmetries. These asymmetries are evident in the 
operations of both parties, manifesting in the utilization of all instruments of state 
power (diplomatic, informational, military, and economic), with consequences 
for both Russian and Ukrainian society. From a strategic standpoint, the Russian 
Federation possesses the capacity to engage in full-scale warfare, conducting strikes 
and exerting influence across all operational domains and throughout the entire 
territory of Ukraine. Conversely, Ukraine exhibits a constrained capability to launch 
strikes on Russian soil and a notable deficiency in its capacity to operate in maritime 
environments, outer space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, when compared to its 
adversary. However, in contrast to the Russian Federation, Ukraine has consistently 
received support from several Western states, which have provided the Ukrainian 
state with a significant military resource for the war effort. Additionally, the Russian 
Federation is subject to a number of economic sanctions that have a significant 
and long-lasting impact on Russian society as a whole. Furthermore, the level of 
determination and motivation among the population differs. The Ukrainian people 
are engaged in a defensive war against an unprovoked aggressor, which creates a 
stronger will to fight than that observed among the Russian military (Ryan 2023).
From an operational point of view, the Ukrainian forces displayed a notable capacity 
to adapt to the evolving demands of the battlefield. Despite facing numerical 
superiority and technological disadvantages, the Ukrainian commanders were able 
to leverage Western weapon systems, combat techniques, and equipment to their 
advantage (Reynolds and Watling 2022). The introduction of the M142 HIMARS 
system into combat and exploitation provides a relevant example in this regard. Its 
engagement in the summer of 2022 generated a series of asymmetries that placed 
the Ukrainian forces in a position of relative advantage. In this context, the principal 
objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the HIMARS tactical-
operational multiple launcher missile system contributed to battlefield success by 
creating asymmetries at the tactical and operational levels of operations. In order 
to direct the research activities and meet the proposed objective, a series of research 
questions were formulated:
 What has been the impact of HIMARS on the tactical and operational 
levels of military operations?
 What was the impact generated by the deployment of HIMARS for the 
development of the operational asymmetries?
 What role did the operational asymmetries generated by HIMARS play in 
determining the success of military operations on the battlefield?
The study considers the period between the second half of June and the end of 
September as a temporal framework, coinciding with the planning, preparation, and 
execution of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv in the autumn of 2022. The 
research findings were obtained through a systematic analysis of satellite images,

which revealed temperature anomalies in the Donbas and Herson areas of operations. 
By interpreting and comparing images provided by NASA’s Fire Information Resource 
Management System, it was possible to identify trends in the conduct of operations, 
while also highlighting the asymmetries achieved by the Ukrainian armed forces, 
which were likely the result of the use of HIMARS. The doctrinal model of operation 
of the Russian forces and the technological characteristics of the HIMARS system 
empirically validate the results obtained. However, it should be noted that the 
information on the conduct of operations on the Ukrainian front and the HIMARS 
system’s deployment may be subject to alteration. This is due to the insufficiency of 
data, the need to protect certain information, or the tendency of both combatants to 
distort it in order to influence and mislead.
Advantage position and operational asymmetry
In a conventional armed conflict between two opposing forces, the aspiration to 
gain the advantage is a constant and fundamental objective. This advantage can be 
achieved at all levels of military operations. Such an advantage is not permanent and 
can be exploited by opposing forces, resulting in a similar advantage for them. Failure 
to exploit an advantageous position can result in its alteration, which, over time, can 
become a position of vulnerability. At the strategic level, advantage can be quantitative 
and qualitative in terms of economic resources, national and international political 
support, available forces and capabilities, or the contribution of allies. The quality of 
leadership and the will to fight are factors that can constitute a position of advantage 
regardless of the level of operations. At the tactical level, advantage is often defined 
as the ability to gain a superior position in relation to the enemy, whether in terms of 
spatial, temporal, or procedural advantage. This can be achieved through the control 
of a key point in the terrain, the attainment of numerical superiority in specific phases 
of the operation, the misleading of the enemy, the exploitation of terrain and weather 
characteristics, or the realization of information superiority.
The advantage is frequently the result of operational asymmetries. Asymmetries 
manifest in the form of disparate operational approaches employed by combatants. 
Such asymmetries may be physical in nature, manifesting as the exploitation of new 
technologies or weapons systems with superior technical and tactical characteristics, 
or procedural in nature, involving the engagement of the enemy in a manner that 
deviates from expectations. Both types of asymmetries facilitate surprise, with the 
implementation of this principle of army combat creating prerequisites for success on 
the battlefield. Furthermore, they generate operational dilemmas for the enemy, and 
the greater the number of such dilemmas, the greater the number of advantageous 
positions (Department of the Army 2017, 1-19)
The concept of advantage, regardless of its nature, is relative. Consequently, the 
attainment of such a position does not necessarily guarantee success. In the Winter

War (November 1939-March 1940), the Soviet forces enjoyed a decisive advantage 
in terms of strength, combat technique, and armaments. However, the Finnish 
army, despite being the weaker force, was able to hold its ground for several 
months by employing asymmetric tactics and exploiting the characteristics of the 
terrain. In contrast, the German armored forces, which were operating according 
to an innovative doctrine, managed to surprise the French army and defeat it in a 
matter of weeks in the spring of 1940. Operation Desert Storm (1991) provides the 
clearest illustration of how success hinges upon exploiting operational asymmetries. 
The rapid and decisive victory achieved by the international coalition against the 
Iraqi armed forces was made possible by the integration of advanced new weapons 
systems under the overarching Big Five concept (Ortiz 2021). The most illustrative 
example of the variable nature of advantage can be observed in unconventional 
conflicts, where asymmetries render traditional advantages inconsequential while 
simultaneously creating new ones. Despite technological advances and superior 
firepower, U.S. forces were compelled to withdraw from Vietnam in 1973, suffering 
a strategic defeat at the hands of the Vietcong. Similarly, the mujahideen guerrillas, 
employing unconventional tactics, gradually eroded the combat strength of the 
Soviet 40th Army in the Russo-Afghan conflict of 1979-1989. A similar sequence 
of events occurred approximately a decade later, when NATO forces withdrew from 
Afghanistan and the Taliban subsequently assumed control of the country.
The contemporary geopolitical landscape has highlighted the necessity to re-examine 
the efficacy of particular armed combat operations (Scrogin 2019). The necessity of 
attaining and exploiting advantage remains a fundamental principle, and operational 
asymmetries continue to be a significant factor in achieving success. Ukraine has 
demonstrated this through the implementation of a distinct command philosophy 
and the exploitation of innovative tactics and operational procedures, which have 
enabled it to effectively counter a quantitatively superior force (Aliyev 2022). Western 
weapons systems have constituted a factor that has provided the Ukrainian forces 
with a tangible tactical advantage, creating opportunities for them to launch attacks 
against the enemy. In this regard, regardless of how the conflict progresses, we are 
interested in the effects of the recently introduced weapons systems, including the 
M142 HIMARS strike complex.
Asymmetric effects generated by the M 142 HIMARS system
in the Donbas area of operations
Over the past two decades, the probability of conventional armed conflict has risen 
considerably. The ongoing conflicts in Georgia, Lebanon, Ukraine, and Nagorno-
Karabakh serve to illustrate this point. Furthermore, the risk of non-conventional 
armed confrontation is also considerable, as evidenced by the ongoing conflicts in 
Yemen and the Gaza Strip. The advent of new technologies has led to the development 
of advanced weapons systems, which are being deployed in the context of modern

conflicts. These developments present an opportunity to test and validate the latest 
generation of anti-tank systems (Spike NLOS, FGM-148 Javelin, NLAW), kamikaze 
drones (Swichblade, Shahed), strike-capable drones (Bayraktar TB 2, Orlan-10), and 
the M142 HIMARS artillery and missile system (Johnson 2022).
In a press release dated 15 July 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense announced 
the supply of 12 M142 HIMARS systems to Ukraine. The press release stated that 
these capabilities would enable Ukrainian forces to strike enemy command points, 
high-precision search and strike systems, installations, and facilities, ammunition, 
or fuel-lubricant depots (Lopez 2022). The HIMARS system represents a distinctive, 
highly effective capability that strategically combines the advantages of extended 
range, high accuracy, and mobility. This has the significant impact of reducing the 
Russian forces’ artillery advantage (Kalin and Michaels 2022). The strike systems 
were introduced to the Ukrainian forces at a time when the Russian Federation 
forces were assuming the initiative in operations in Eastern Ukraine, specifically in 
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Subsequent to the capture of Sieverodonetsk and 
Lysychansk, the Russian forces augmented their offensive operations in the direction 
of Bakhmut-Kramatorsk, concurrently with extensive envelopment maneuvers from 
Lyman (North) and Horlivka (South), with the objective of encircling the Ukrainian 
forces in the area of Kramatorsk (Hird, Stepanenko et. al 2022). In accordance with 
the findings of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
(UAF) initiated the utilization of American M142 HIMARS systems, successfully 
striking a number of pivotal targets belonging to the Russian forces (Hird, Mappes 
et. al 2022).
In light of the aforementioned information and the primary objectives of this weapon 
system, it is estimated that HIMARS was employed in support of the forces engaged 
in the Donbas area of operations with the objective of impeding the advancement of 
Russian forces along the Bakhmut-Kramatorsk offensive axis. A number of satellite 
images captured by the Forward-Looking Infrared Radar (FIRMS) system in the 
Lyman - Bakhmut - Horlivka contact zone have revealed the presence of several 
thermal anomalies within the area of operations at the contact, as well as thermal 
anomalies in the rear of the Russian forces. The thermal anomalies are characterized 
by a high thermal footprint, which can be temporally and spatially delineated with 
the aid of GIS (Geographic Information System) tools. By taking 6 July 2022 as a 
reference date, it can be observed that there is a high frequency of thermal anomalies 
along the front line, which are also of high intensity. The thermal anomalies indicate 
elevated temperatures at the ground level, which, according to experts, are caused 
by the intense firing of artillery and rocket systems. The anomalies occur in both the 
area of the points of origin (POO) and the area of the points of impact (POI) of the 
hits. Consequently, the analysis of the thermal spectrum of the contact area indicates 
that on 6 July, Russian forces sustained an intense artillery barrage, most likely in 
order to shape a future offensive operation.

The analysis of satellite imagery from the period following 6 June 2022 indicates a 
gradual decline in the thermal anomalies. This is evidenced by the data presented in 
Figure No.2, which shows that the anomalies are significantly reduced on 14 July in 
comparison to the thermal spectral image of 6 July. Based on this information, we 
can make the following estimation:
- there was a notable reduction in the intensity of artillery fire in the contact 
zone between 9 and 14 July 2022;
- one of the reasons for the reduction in thermal anomalies caused by artillery 
fire is the decrease in the quantity of ammunition available to the Russian 
forces to support their offensive actions;
- it seems reasonable to conclude that the introduction of the HIMARS system 
in combat allowed the Ukrainians to strike at the main lines of communication 
and the ammunition depots of the Russian Federation forces located on the 
tactical depth of the maneuver brigades and divisions; the thermal anomalies 
that have been recorded in the rear zone of the combat device of the Russian 
units appear to confirm the hypothesis that the logistics facilities have been hit;
- the necessity to impede the advancement of Russian forces along the 
Bakhmut-Kramatorsk axis is likely to have been the primary factor in the 
extensive deployment of the HIMARS system in this operational area; the 
variations in thermal anomalies observed empirically appear to corroborate 
this hypothesis;
- the deployment of the HIMARS system has had an asymmetric impact, 
resulting in the culmination of the Russian forces’ engagement along the 
primary offensive axis, Bakhmut-Kramatorsk.
On 15 July, there are several indications that Russian forces are intensifying their 
preparations to resume the offensive in three main directions converging on the

city of Kramatorsk. This is with the aim of encircling Ukrainian forces in the so-
called “cauldron” formed between Yizum, Bakhmut, Horlivka, and Donetsk. At this 
juncture in the military campaign, the city of Kramatorsk remains a key objective in 
the Donbas region. The capture of Kramatorsk would have constituted a significant 
milestone in the broader strategic objective of the Russian Federation to “liberate” 
the two breakaway provinces (Hird, Mappes et. al 2022). At the time, Western 
experts had reservations about the capacity of Russian forces to concentrate sufficient 
combat power to breach Ukrainian defences. The deployment of HIMARS systems in 
combat has served to reinforce these concerns, with military specialists anticipating 
the sustained targeting of communication lines, command points, and, in particular, 
concentrations of logistical resources (Ryan 2022). The analysis of satellite imagery 
from 15-20 July 2022 reveals the progression of thermal anomalies in the Donbas 
area of operations. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that between 15 and 
16 July, the Russian Federation forces increased the intensity of their strikes in the 
contact zone, indicating a probable preparation for further offensive actions. The 
thermal anomalies observed in the rear area of the Russian forces’ combat device 
are likely to be the result of strikes on ammunition depots, as evidenced by the 
subsequent fire and anomalies in the thermal spectrum (see Figure No. 3).
The Russian forces continued their offensive operations on 17 July, but these were 
unsuccessful. By 18 July, the analysis of thermal anomalies in the contact zone 
indicated that the intensity of the Russian forces’ offensive was diminishing. In 
conclusion, it can be stated that the offensive actions of the Russian Federation 
forces on 15-20 July 2022 have reached their peak as a direct consequence of the lack 
of resources, in particular artillery ammunition. It is highly probable that since 18 
July, the quantity of ammunition available to the contact forces has been significantly 
reduced as a result of the interception and obstruction of ground communication 
lines in the rear area, as well as the destruction of ammunition depots.

The effective utilization of HIMARS systems enabled the Ukrainian forces to 
achieve their tactical objectives in the Donbas area of operations. These included 
the blocking of offensive actions in the Bahmut-Kramatorsk direction and the 
creation of conditions conducive to an offensive. The constant targeting of rear lines 
of communication, logistic depots, training and concentration areas, and Russian 
command points resulted in the creation of tactical asymmetries that contributed 
significantly to the success of the Ukrainian forces. These asymmetries manifested 
in the capacity to engage vulnerable targets with enhanced precision, at extended 
ranges, and with greater efficacy than analogous systems operational within the 
Russian armed forces. The system’s inability to counter both the munition and 
the platform represents another tactical asymmetry with decisive implications for 
achieving success. Consequently, the GPS-guided projectile-reactive munitions with 
a range of up to 80 km enabled the targeting of the logistic system of enemy regiments

and maneuver brigades situated at a distance of 25-40 km from the front line. By 
conducting brief incursions, HIMARS systems were capable of striking targets at 
distances of up to 60-70 km, encompassing the areas of maneuver divisions’ logistic 
deployment within the system’s operational range (Ponomarenko 2022). The Russian 
forces’ command and control system was the primary target of the combined assault 
on Ukrainian forces, with HIMARS playing a key role in the destruction of vital 
command infrastructure. The strategic targeting of high-level command nodes and 
the elimination of numerous officers and generals not only disrupted the Russians’ 
command and control capabilities but also contributed to the overall success on the 
battlefield (Beagle, Slider and Arrol 2023). Finally, the Ukrainians have exploited 
the inefficiency of information security operations conducted by Russian forces, 
utilizing HIMARS to strike training and accommodation facilities. This asymmetry 
has had a significant impact on the morale of Russian troops, further contributing to 
the erosion of trust within the chain of command (Kirby 2023).
Asymmetric effects generated by the M 142 HIMARS system
in the Herson area of operations
The Ukrainian Armed Forces continued to successfully employ M142 HIMARS 
systems throughout August 2022, utilizing them to shape the battlespace and create 
a range of asymmetric effects. The strikes conducted by these systems were designed 
to degrade the logistical system of Russian Federation forces at the tactical and 
operational levels. This was achieved by striking a range of strategic targets, including 
ammunition depots, command points, supply and refueling points, bridges over 
waterways, airfields, reserve concentration districts, and key points on the ground. 
The objective was to disrupt enemy lines of communication (Kalin and Michaels 
2022). The creation of these effects was intended to achieve the objectives set out 
in the offensive operations conducted in the Herson and Kharkiv operational areas. 
The intensification of strikes in the rear area of Russian forces in Herson resulted 
in the transfer of some Russian forces from the Kharkiv area of operations. This 
facilitated the success of the offensive operations carried out by Ukrainian forces in 
this direction in early September. Concurrently, the systematic targeting of forced 
crossing points and logistical hubs in the Herson area caused confusion among 
Russian commanders regarding the primary direction of the effort. The relocation of 
the reconnaissance effort from Kharkiv enabled the Ukrainian forces to concentrate 
sufficient resources in the area to impede the enemy’s activities, which ultimately 
contributed to the success of the offensive operation. Figure 5 illustrates the striking 
of the primary crossing points (permanent and temporary) over the Dnieper River 
utilized by the Russian Federation to resupply forces on the right bank of the river.
The research findings indicate that this was feasible only through the rapid 
deployment of Ukrainian armed forces from the Mykolaev region and the utilization 
of HIMARS systems to neutralize the targets. Given the necessity of executing high-

precision strikes to achieve the desired effects, it is notable that the forces in question 
had various sensors in the vicinity of the target. These were used to provide the 
coordinates and maintain positive identification (PID), as well as to perform target 
effects assessment (BDA). Figure 6 illustrates the range capabilities of the HIMARS 
system. In the period under consideration, GMLRS-type munitions were employed, 
whereas ATACMS munitions were not available to the Ukrainian forces.
Conclusions
The analysis conducted led to the generation of results that, by virtue of their 
consistency, provide answers to the research questions. The effects generated by the 
American-origin M142 HIMARS system facilitated the implementation of a maneuver 
approach to operations, allowing the Ukrainian forces to strike at the enemy’s

vulnerabilities, affecting both the physical and psychological components of their 
combat power. In consideration of the assessed time period, it can be observed that 
the operational asymmetries generated by the combat engagement of the HIMARS 
system enabled the Ukrainians to gain an advantageous position, concomitant with 
the disintegration of the command and control system of the Russian armed forces 
and the isolation of their forces. By striking at the ammunition depots situated at 
the tactical depth of the Russian forces’ defensive perimeter, the Ukrainian forces 
were able to inflict consistent and significant damage to the advantage held by the 
Russian Federation in terms of artillery capabilities. Furthermore, by methodically 
targeting the crossings over the Dnieper, the Russian forces’ supply capacity on the 
right bank of the river was gradually reduced. The impact of the HIMARS systems 
in the Herson area of operations contributed to misleading the Russian forces 
about the commencement of another large-scale operation in the Kharkiv area of 
operations. The redeployment of Russian forces in the north to counter the potential 
threat in the Herson area created the necessary conditions for a successful Ukrainian 
counteroffensive in the Kharkiv area. Furthermore, the sustained pressure on Russian 
forces in the Herson area of operations, coupled with the interception of their lines of 
communication, prompted the Russian Federation’s political and military decision-
makers to withdraw all forces on the left bank of the Dnieper by the end of October 
2022. The Russian withdrawal South of the Dnieper, as well as the success of the 
Kharkiv counteroffensive, can be attributed to the effective exploitation of HIMARS 
strike systems. The analysis of resource imagery highlighting thermal anomalies in 
contact zones provides empirical results that validate the effectiveness of those firing 
systems and their ability to generate tactical asymmetries.
The adaptation process has enabled the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation 
to modify their operations in a manner that mitigates the impact of HIMARS 
systems. Over the past two years, tactical adaptations have manifested at both 
procedural and technological levels. In terms of tactics and procedures, the Russian 
forces have deployed their districts and logistic bases outside the HIMARS range. 
Furthermore, measures have been implemented to disperse forces outside the 
designated contact area and to minimize the multispectral footprint of command 
points. In terms of technological adaptation, electronic warfare systems have been 
calibrated to affect the precision and accuracy of munitions. The combination of 
air defense and EW capabilities has resulted in a notable reduction in their overall 
effectiveness. However, the continued deployment of HIMARS systems on the 
battlefield in Ukraine has demonstrated their continued lethality. Despite the 
reduced effectiveness of these systems, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have employed 
innovative tactics and misleading operations to create and exploit windows of 
opportunity, thereby overcoming the multiple layers of defense deployed by Russian 
Federation forces. It can be concluded that these versatile systems have the potential 
to continue to serve as combat power multipliers in the future, thus contributing to 
success on the battlefield.
